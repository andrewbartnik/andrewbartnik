# Student | Master of Environmental Data Science  
## University of California, Santa Barbara

Hi!
My name is Andrew! I'm an aspiring Data Scientist currently enrolled in the Masters of Environmental Data Science program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. 

I grew up in Melbourne, Australia, where I fell in love with the natural world. I finished my undergraduate career at the University of Arkansas with degrees in Chemistry, Biology, and Environmental Science, along with minors in Mathematics and Physics. My initial interests took me into the world of Astrobiology, where the possibility of finding life beyond Earth deeply fascinated me. I was first exposed to the importance of data skills when I was running Deep Earth Water (DEW) models to simulate the thermodynamics of amino acid synthesis under conditions hypothesized to exist on Enceladus, using data captured from the Cassini probe. I quickly realized that I wanted to be broadly, yet rigorously trained in data science - the techniques of which I hope to apply towards solving a wide range of environmental problems. I am broadly interested in the insight machine learning can provide towards understanding large scale climatic/oceanic and planetary processes.
